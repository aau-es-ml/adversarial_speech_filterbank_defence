<h1>LEVERAGING DOMAIN FEATURES FOR DETECTING ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS AGAINST DEEP SPEECH RECOGNITION IN NOISE</h1>

<p>Can you distinguish these two samples?</p>

<p>And if we let you know, a common voice assistant would register one of these samples as "Open all doors"?</p>

<p>This work strives to detect these adversarial attacks by employing the underutilised power of cepstral coefficients computed using cleverly designed filter-banks and especially inverse filter-banks as shown in our article.</p>
